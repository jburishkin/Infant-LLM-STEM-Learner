## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jburishkin/Infant-LLM-v6.3-Full.git
cd Infant-LLM-v6.3-Full
bash setup.sh
```

Then open your browser to **http://localhost:5000** (or your server IP).

## 🌱 About
Infant LLM is a minimal, evolving neural assistant that starts as a blank-slate learner and grows in understanding through your input. It learns **Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)** organically — just like a human child.

## 🧩 Growth Stages
- 👶 **Infant** — no built-in math or logic; must be taught everything
- 🧒 **Child** — basic inference and recall patterns
- 🧑‍🎓 **Teenager** — symbolic math and logical context
- 🧠 **Adult** — full hybrid reasoning (Smart Recall + generation)

## 🔧 Installation
- Python 3.10–3.12
- CPU or GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel supported by PyTorch install)
- On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## 💬 Usage
- Teach: `learn cats are mammals`  
- Query memory: `memory`, `memory math`, `memory cats`
- Math (Teenager+): `what is 2+3=` or `5*(4+1)=`
- Clear: use **🧹 Clear Memory** in the UI

Keyboard shortcuts: **Enter** to send, **Shift+Enter** for a new line.

## 📈 Growth Summary & Evolution
- Sidebar shows **stage**, **learned items**, and **maturity %**
- Visuals: 🌱 plant sprout (Infant→Teen) → 🧠 brain pulse (Teen→Adult)
- Auto-suggests stage upgrade when thresholds are met (no popups; subtle UI)

## 🧭 Future Development Roadmap
- v6.4 — Multi-user growth
- v6.5 — Secure SSO (Google/Microsoft/GitHub, incl. GCC High)
- v6.6 — Reinforcement & adaptive learning
- v6.7 — Collaborative cloud edition
