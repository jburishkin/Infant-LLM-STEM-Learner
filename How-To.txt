# Infant LLM v6.1 — STEM Learner
### User Guide (How-To)

---

## 🧩 Overview
**Infant LLM v6.1** is a small, evolving neural assistant designed to learn **directly from you**.  
It begins as a blank model with no predefined knowledge. Everything it “knows” comes from your input — facts, math, code, and scientific information you teach it.

The model is ideal for **STEM exploration** (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and for experimenting with how a local language model can learn incrementally.

---

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### Minimum
- Python 3.10+
- CPU (Intel, AMD, or ARM)
- ~2 GB RAM

### Recommended
- GPU (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel / Apple)
- 4+ GB RAM
- Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

---

## 🧰 Installation Steps

### 1. Clone or copy the project folder
Place the following files in your working directory:
```
infantLM_v6_1.py
infant_ui_v6_1.html
```

### 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv infantenv
source infantenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install flask torch numpy faiss-cpu
```
If you have GPU acceleration (CUDA or ROCm):
```bash
pip install faiss-gpu
```

### 4. Run the server
```bash
python3 infantLM_v6_1.py
```
Then open your browser and visit:
👉 [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧠 Teaching the Model

You “teach” the Infant by using `learn` commands.  
It stores each lesson, updates its neural network slightly, and saves memory persistently.

### Examples
```text
learn the sky is blue
learn grass is green
learn math: 1+1=2
learn science: water boils at 100 °C
learn coding: print("hello world")
learn engineering: a lever amplifies force
```

Each “learn” command trains the model a bit and stores it in memory.

---

## 🔍 Exploring Memory

You can view what the Infant knows using `memory` commands.

### Show all memory (top 30 recent)
```text
memory
```

### Filter by category
```text
memory math
memory science
memory coding
memory engineering
memory technology
```

### Search by keyword
```text
memory sky
memory water
```

---

## 🧮 Math Reasoning

Infant v6.1 includes a built-in math evaluator.

Try these:
```text
what is 2+3=
5*(4+1)=
(12/3)+6=
```

It detects expressions and calculates results directly, even when mixed into natural text.

---

## 💬 Asking Questions

After teaching a few facts, you can chat normally:

```text
what color is the sky
describe water
what does a lever do
python loop example
```

The model searches its learned memory and responds with relevant information.

---

## 🧹 Managing Memory

The sidebar includes buttons to manage the memory.

### 🔄 Refresh Memory
Reloads the top 30 recent items.

### 🧹 Clear Memory
Deletes all stored knowledge and resets learning.  
Confirmation is required before erasing.

You can also clear memory via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/clear_memory
```

## ⚙️ Interface Controls

| Setting | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Personality** | Switch between 🧠 *Playful* and ⚙️ *Serious* modes (changes tone and favicon). |
| **Creativity (temperature)** | Controls how “creative” replies are. Lower = factual, higher = imaginative. |
| **Prefer type** | Filter replies toward a specific category (math, coding, etc.). |

## 🔒 Privacy & Offline Use

Infant LLM runs **entirely locally**.  
- No data leaves your computer.  
- No internet connection required.  
- Ideal for isolated or secure environments.  

---

## 🧭 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'** | Run `pip install flask` inside your environment |
| **No GPU detected** | The system will fall back to CPU automatically |
| **UI not showing** | Ensure `infant_ui_v6_1.html` is in the same folder as the `.py` file |
| **Memory not clearing** | Refresh the page after clearing memory |
| **Loss always increasing** | Normal for small text snippets; larger datasets improve training |

---

## 🧠 Teaching Tips

- Start small: clear, factual sentences work best.  
- Use category tags (`learn math:`, `learn coding:`) for better organization.  
- Periodically check memory to confirm retention.  
- Lower temperature (0.3–0.6) for logic-heavy topics.  
- Raise temperature (0.9–1.5) for creative reasoning.

## 🧮 Example Session

```
You: learn math: 1+1=2
Infant: Learned (math) loss≈1.386

You: learn math: 2+2=4
Infant: Learned (math) loss≈1.616

You: memory math
Memory hint: [math] 1+1=2
Memory hint: [math] 2+2=4
Infant: Listed all math memories.

You: what is 2+3=
Infant: 2+3 = 5
```
