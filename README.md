# 🧠 Infant LLM v6 — STEM Learner

> An evolving local neural assistant that learns **Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)** directly from your input.  
> Teach it facts, equations, and code — it remembers, reasons, and grows over time.

## 🚀 Overview

**Infant LLM v6** is a lightweight, self-growing language model that starts with no predefined knowledge.  
It learns entirely from **your interactions** and evolves as you teach it.

It’s built for **education**, **STEM experimentation**, and **AI research** — exploring how small models can grow into capable assistants through incremental learning.
